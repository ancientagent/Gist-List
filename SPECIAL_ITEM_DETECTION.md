# Special Item Detection - Free Tier Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented **Special Item Detection** for the Free Tier with proper premium gating. The AI now **ALWAYS** detects special items (Vintage, Collectible, Antique, Luxury, Custom, Art, Rare) regardless of premium status, but only shows full premium features (facts, links, grading) when premium is unlocked.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **AI Prompt Updates** (`/app/api/listings/[id]/analyze/route.ts`)

#### New Section 11: Special Item Detection (ALWAYS REQUIRED)
- **Always runs** regardless of premium status
- Detects 7 special item categories:
  - **Vintage** - Items 20+ years old with nostalgic/historical value
  - **Collectible** - Items sought by collectors (trading cards, limited editions, memorabilia)
  - **Antique** - Items 100+ years old with historical significance
  - **Luxury** - High-end designer items (Rolex, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel, etc.)
  - **Custom** - Custom-made, handcrafted, or one-of-a-kind items
  - **Art** - Original artwork, sculptures, fine art pieces
  - **Rare** - Limited production, hard to find, discontinued items with collector demand

#### New JSON Response Fields
```json
{
  "isPremiumItem": true,
  "specialClass": "Vintage",
  "specialItemReason": "This 1978 Fender Stratocaster is a vintage collectible guitar from Fender's golden era, sought after by collectors and musicians for its iconic sound and craftsmanship.",
  "premiumFacts": null,  // Only populated when premium is unlocked
  "usefulLinks": null    // Only populated when premium is unlocked
}
```

#### Database Updates
- `isPremiumItem` - Boolean flag (saved for all items)
- `specialClass` - Category of special item (saved for all items)
- Both fields are **always saved**, regardless of premium status

---

### 2. **Smart Notification System**

When a **special item is detected** for a **free user** (premium not unlocked):

#### Notification Created
- **Type**: `INSIGHT` (yellow badge)
- **Action Type**: `special_item_detected`
- **Message Format**: 
  ```
  ðŸŽ¯ [Special Class] Item Detected! [Reason explanation]. Unlock premium features to access detailed insights, collector information, and helpful resources.
  ```

#### Example
```
ðŸŽ¯ Vintage Item Detected! This 1978 Fender Stratocaster is a vintage collectible guitar from Fender's golden era, sought after by collectors and musicians for its iconic sound and craftsmanship. Unlock premium features to access detailed insights, collector information, and helpful resources.
```

### 3. **UI Updates** (`premium-packs-section.tsx`)

#### Special Item Banner
When a special item is detected (free tier, premium not unlocked):
- **Eye-catching gradient banner** at the top of the Premium Packs section
- **Animated sparkle icon** to draw attention
- **Clear messaging**:
  - "ðŸŽ¯ [Special Class] Item Detected!"
  - Explanation that premium features will help them sell faster and for more money

#### Visual Design
- Gradient: `purple-600 â†’ fuchsia-600 â†’ pink-600`
- White text with animated Sparkles icon
- Prominent placement above premium tabs

## How It Works

### Free Tier User Flow

1. **User uploads item photo** (e.g., vintage camera, collectible card, luxury watch)
2. **AI analyzes and detects** it's a special item
3. **System saves** `isPremiumItem: true` and `specialClass: "Vintage"`
4. **Notification created** explaining what makes it special
5. **Premium banner shown** with upgrade call-to-action
6. **Premium features remain locked** (no premiumFacts, no usefulLinks)

### Premium Tier User Flow

1. **User uploads special item** and enables premium
2. **AI analyzes and detects** it's a special item
3. **System saves** `isPremiumItem: true` and generates full data:
   - `premiumFacts` - Detailed collector information, history, value insights
   - `usefulLinks` - Manuals, repair shops, parts suppliers, forums
4. **Banner shows** "Premium Active" status
5. **Full premium data displayed** in the UI

---

## Business Logic

### Detection is FREE
- Special item detection runs for **all users**
- Classification (Vintage, Collectible, etc.) is **always saved**
- Brief explanation (specialItemReason) is **shown to free users**

### Premium Features are GATED
- `premiumFacts` - Only generated when premium is unlocked
- `usefulLinks` - Only generated when premium is unlocked
- Full grading/facet data - Only accessible with premium
- Detailed collector insights - Premium only
