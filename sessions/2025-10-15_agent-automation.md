# 2025-10-15 â€“ Agent Automation Stack

## Summary
- Added Electron-based localhost agent with consent overlay, policy enforcement, and Puppeteer Core integration.
- Delivered TypeScript SDK, recipe samples, and CLI runner for Poshmark/Mercari automation demos.
- Integrated backend routes (`/api/agent/*`) with Prisma models (`AgentDevice`, `AgentSession`) and SSE proxy.
- Authored supporting documentation (AGENT_API, RECIPES, LOCAL_DEV) and updated README quickstart.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Add automated health checks from backend to keep device status fresh.
- Implement background worker to clean expired agent sessions.
- Expand recipe library beyond Poshmark/Mercari once selectors are stabilized.
