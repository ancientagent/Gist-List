# 2025-10-18 â€“ Agent Hardening Follow-up

## Summary
- Tightened Electron session manager to bind tokens to their domain, honour per-action scopes, and expire sessions gracefully.
- Normalized file upload handling for `file://` URIs and absolute paths, keeping navigation inside the approved allow-list.
- Filtered invalid agent actions during token minting and documented the new error codes for denied/expired consent states.

## Testing
- npm install (fails: npm registry returns 403 for `jose`).
