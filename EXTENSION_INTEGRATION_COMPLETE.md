```

---

## 📊 API Integration Details

### Authentication Headers
```javascript
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Example: Sync Listings
```javascript
GET /api/extension/listings
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer {token}" }
Response: {
  listings: [
    {
      id: "123",
      title: "Item Name",
      description: "...",
      price: 99.99,
      category: "Electronics",
      images: ["url1", "url2"],
      recommendedPlatforms: ["ebay", "mercari"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example: Schedule Post
```javascript
POST /api/extension/schedule
Body: {
  listingId: "123",
  platforms: ["ebay", "mercari"],
  scheduledTime: "2025-10-13T19:00:00Z",
  useAITime: true
}
Response: {
  scheduledPost: {
    id: "sp_456",
    listingId: "123",
    platforms: ["ebay", "mercari"],
    scheduledTime: "2025-10-13T19:00:00Z",
    status: "PENDING"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Premium Feature: Scheduled Posting

### How It Works:
1. **User selects scheduling option** (AI or Custom)
2. **Extension calls API** to create ScheduledPost record
3. **Backend stores** schedule in database
4. **Cron job/scheduler** (to be implemented) checks for pending posts
5. **At scheduled time**, backend triggers extension to post
6. **Extension executes** posting via content scripts
7. **Updates status** to POSTED or FAILED

### AI Recommendation Logic:
```javascript
Category-based recommendations:
- Electronics → 7pm (Evening browsing peak)
- Clothing → 8pm (Evening shopping time)
- Collectibles → 2pm (Weekend afternoon)
- Furniture → 10am (Morning home browsing)
- Default → 6pm (General peak traffic)
```
