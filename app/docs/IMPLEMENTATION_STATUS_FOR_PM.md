## What Has Been Built

### 1. Intelligent Notification System ‚úÖ

**Four Notification Types with Distinct Behaviors:**

- **ALERT** (Red) - Required fields, blocking issues
  - Example: "Price is required to calculate profit margins"
  - Behavior: Must be addressed, opens chip bin with relevant options

- **PHOTO** (Purple) - Photo capture requests
  - Example: "Add close-up of doll's eyes - condition affects value"
  - Behavior: Opens Camera/Upload dialog, extracts action keywords
  - Helper text: "üì∏ Select to add closeup"

- **INSIGHT** (Amber) - AI-powered optimization tips (Premium feature)
  - Example: "Mention if stored in smoke-free home - collectors care about preservation"
  - Behavior: Opens chip bin, adds to description as bullet points

- **QUESTION** (Blue) - Clarifications that improve listing quality
  - Example: "Is this from Japan, Germany, or the US? Origin affects value"
  - Behavior: Opens chip bin with context-aware answer options

**Files**:
- `app/listing/[id]/_components/notification-list.tsx`
- `app/api/notifications/[id]/resolve/route.ts`

### 2. Context-Aware Smart Chip System ‚úÖ

**The Principle**: "If the AI knows enough to ask the question, it must provide the answers."

**Three-Tier Option Priority:**
1. **actionData.options** (highest) - Explicitly provided by notification generator
2. **Message parsing** - Extract options from question text
3. **Generic categories** (fallback) - Default chip categories

**Example in Action:**
```json
// Notification with context-aware options
{
  "message": "Is this from Japan, Germany, or the US? Origin affects value",
  "actionData": {
    "options": ["Japan", "Germany", "The US", "Unknown"],
    "section": "fineDetails"
  }
}
```

**Smart Parsing Features:**
- Handles country names and acronyms ("the US" ‚Üí "The US")
- Extracts options from natural language questions
- Formats responses appropriately for the target field

**Files**:
- `app/listing/[id]/_components/smart-chip-bin.tsx`
- `docs/CONTEXT_AWARE_CHIPS.md`

### 3. Multi-Entry Chip Support Foundation ‚úÖ

**Problem Solved**: Some notifications require multiple entries
- Example: "Is there anything else buyers should know about this item?"
- User needs to add several details before closing

**What's Implemented:**
- `allowMultiple` prop on SmartChipBin component
- `addedItems` state to track multiple entries
- Toast feedback: "Detail added! Add more or tap Done."
- Handler modifications to not close immediately in multi-entry mode

**What's Pending** (for next iteration):
- "Done" button UI at bottom of chip bin
- Added items list display at top
- Wire up `allowMultiple` prop from notification-list for specific notification types

**Files**: `app/listing/[id]/_components/smart-chip-bin.tsx`

### 4. Conditional Notification Filtering ‚úÖ

**Locals-Only Shipping Filter:**
- When user selects "Locals Only" fulfillment, shipping notifications automatically disappear
- No insurance questions, no carrier recommendations, no shipping weight prompts
- Dynamic filtering based on `fulfillmentType` prop

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const filteredNotifications = fulfillmentType === 'local'
  ? notifications.filter(n => n.field !== 'shipping')
  : notifications;
```

**Files**:
- `app/listing/[id]/_components/notification-list.tsx`
- `app/listing/[id]/_components/listing-detail.tsx`

### 5. Platform-Specific Conditional Fields ‚úÖ

**Comprehensive Hardwired Fields for 9 Platforms:**

Each platform now has category-based conditional fields that appear in Premium "Fine Details" tabs.

**Platform Coverage:**
- **eBay**: 8+ fields (Handling Time, UPC/EAN, MPN, ISBN, Publication Year, Size Type, Country of Manufacture)
- **Mercari**: 2 fields (Shipping Weight ‚ö†Ô∏è required, Department)
- **Poshmark**: 3 fields (Department ‚ö†Ô∏è required, Original Retail Price, NWT)
- **Facebook Marketplace**: 3 fields (Fulfillment Options, Mileage, VIN)
- **OfferUp**: 2 fields (Firm Price?, Mileage)
- **Craigslist**: 4 fields (Neighborhood/Area, Delivery Available?, VIN, Mileage)
- **Nextdoor**: 2 fields (Pickup Instructions, Cross-posted elsewhere?)
- **Reverb**: 6 fields (Year, Serial Number, Finish/Color, Country of Manufacture, Handedness, Includes)
- **Vinted**: 2 fields (Package Size ‚ö†Ô∏è required, Gender)

**Key Features:**
- Category-based conditional logic (VIN only for vehicles, ISBN only for books, etc.)
- Auto-population from listing data where available
- Confidence scores with "AI uncertain" badges
- Platform-specific badges ("eBay only", "Reverb only")

**Architecture Decision**: Fields are **hardwired**, not AI-generated, because:
- Platform requirements are deterministic
- More reliable than AI discovery
- AI can populate values, but field structure is fixed

**Files**: `app/listing/[id]/_components/platform-preview.tsx`

### 6. Special Items & Facets Framework ‚úÖ

**The Five Facets** (Value-Defining Features):

1. **Authentication** - Tags, serial numbers, signatures, certificates
2. **Condition** - Paint integrity, wear patterns, structural soundness
3. **Rarity** - Limited editions, variants, prototypes, discontinued items
4. **Provenance** - Original packaging, manuals, certificates, ownership history
5. **Completeness** - Accessories, documentation, ephemera, original components

**UX Concept**: "Antiques Roadshow Experience"
- "Do you have any idea what this is worth?" revelation moment
- AI identifies facets from photos and descriptions
- Value calculation shows impact of verified facets
- Example: $1,500 estimate ‚Üí $12,700 with verified facets

**6-Step PHOTO Workflow for Special Items:**
1. User uploads photo responding to PHOTO notification
2. AI performs quality check (lighting, focus, angle, completeness)
3. If acceptable: AI analyzes photo for facets
4. AI generates condition assessment
5. Condition text auto-appends to description
6. Notification resolves, value recalculates

**Files**: `docs/SPECIAL_ITEMS_FEATURE.md`

### 7. Verified Condition Report ‚úÖ

- Aggregates accepted photo scores into `Listing.verifiedConditionScore` and derives `Listing.verifiedCondition`.
- Listing detail UI shows the GISTer Verified badge, four-dimension progress bars, and a ¬±7% pricing band once verification data exists.
- Honors `userPreferences.conditionReportMode` (all / premium / off) before rendering the card.
- Migration `20251011144014_add_verified_condition` adds the new fields.

### 8. Premium Specials & Roadshow Reveal ‚úÖ

- Photo verification deduplicates facets, infers `specialClass`, persists capped `priceUplifts`, and toggles `Listing.isPremiumItem`.
- `listing-detail.tsx` renders the Roadshow Reveal card (baseline vs verified value, facet contributions, upgrade CTA) plus a special-item banner.
- Pricing ladder helpers now use `applyPremiumUplift`, capping premiums at +20% and skipping parts-only conditions.
- Migration `20251011161045_add_is_premium_item` introduces the boolean flag.

### 9. Telemetry Infrastructure üîÑ

- Added `TelemetryEvent` model/migration `20251011173000_add_telemetry_events`.
- Logging helper `lib/telemetry.ts` captures backend events (photo workflow, condition verification, price uplifts).
- New events emitted: `photo_request`, `photo_uploaded`, `photo_verified`, `condition_verified`, `facet_value_computed`, `price_updated`.
- Client-side notification/chip telemetry remains TODO per Slice 5 scope.

### 10. Notification Field Semantics (Clarified) ‚úÖ

**Field Classification System:**

- `field: "fineDetails"` ‚Üí Platform-specific conditional fields (UPC, ISBN, Serial Number)
- `field: "description"` or `field: NULL` ‚Üí Marketing copy, descriptive text, bullet points
- `field: "shipping"` ‚Üí Used for conditional filtering (locals-only)
- `field: "photos"` ‚Üí Photo-related fields

**Example:**
```json
// Platform field notification
{
  "field": "fineDetails",
  "message": "What is the UPC/EAN barcode?",
  "actionType": "fill_field"
}

// Description enhancement notification
{
  "field": null,
  "message": "Mention if stored in smoke-free home",
  "actionType": "add_detail"
}
```

## Database Schema Understanding

### Notification Schema
```prisma
model AINotification {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  listingId   String
  type        String   // ALERT, PHOTO, INSIGHT, QUESTION
  message     String
  field       String?  // Can be null for description additions
  actionType  String?  // fill_field, add_detail, add_photo
  actionData  String?  // JSON string with options, section, etc.
  resolved    Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())

  listing     Listing  @relation(fields: [listingId], references: [id])
}
```

### Recent Database Changes Made:
```sql
-- Deleted out-of-scope notifications
DELETE FROM "AINotification" WHERE id = 'notif-7';  -- Make Offer (buyer-side)
DELETE FROM "AINotification" WHERE id = 'notif-8';  -- Double-boxing (informational)

-- Reclassified box condition from PHOTO to INSIGHT
UPDATE "AINotification"
SET type = 'INSIGHT', actionType = 'add_detail', field = 'photos'
WHERE id = 'notif-2';

-- Fixed smoke-free home field (description, not fineDetails)
UPDATE "AINotification"
SET field = NULL
WHERE id = 'notif-14';

-- Added context-aware options
UPDATE "AINotification"
SET
  message = 'Is this from Japan, Germany, or the US? Origin affects value',
  actionData = '{"options": ["Japan", "Germany", "The US"], "section": "fineDetails"}',
  field = NULL
WHERE id = 'notif-12';
```

---

## Architecture Patterns Established

### 1. Notification Generation Pattern
```typescript
// When AI generates notifications, it MUST include options for questions
{
  type: 'QUESTION',
  message: 'What color is the item?',
  actionData: JSON.stringify({
    options: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Black', 'White', 'Other'],
    section: 'description'
  }),
  field: null
}
```

### 2. Premium Auto-Population Pattern
**Rule**: For Premium listings with photos:
- AI should auto-populate fields and NOT generate notifications
- Only generate notifications when AI cannot determine value from available data

**Rule**: For Premium listings without photos:
- Generate notifications WITH context-aware options
- Options come from research AI did to formulate the question

### 3. Chip Selection to Text Pattern
```typescript
// Generic chip: "Excellent condition"
// Formatted for description: "‚Ä¢ Item is in excellent condition"

// Answer chip: "Japan"
// Formatted for description: "‚Ä¢ Made in Japan" or added to fineDetails field
```

### 4. Multi-Entry Pattern
```typescript
// For notifications requiring multiple entries:
allowMultiple = true

// User flow:
// 1. Tap notification ‚Üí chip bin opens
// 2. Select chip ‚Üí "Detail added! Add more or tap Done."
// 3. Select another chip ‚Üí "Detail added! Add more or tap Done."
// 4. Tap "Done" ‚Üí All entries saved, notification resolves
```

## Testing Checklist Completed

### ‚úÖ Tested & Working

- [x] Notification rendering (4 types with distinct colors/icons)
- [x] Context-aware chip parsing from question messages
- [x] Context-aware chip options from actionData.options
- [x] PHOTO notification dialog (Camera/Upload)
- [x] Notification resolution via X button
- [x] Chip selection adds to description
- [x] Multi-entry foundation (tracking, toast feedback)

### ‚è≥ Pending Testing

- [ ] Locals-only shipping filter (requires listing with notifications)
- [ ] Platform-specific fields on all 9 platforms (requires Premium)
- [ ] Multi-entry complete flow (UI not finished)

---

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### 1. Multi-Entry UI Incomplete
**Status**: Foundation code complete, UI elements pending
**Impact**: Low - Single-entry mode works perfectly
**Next Steps**: Add Done button, added items display, wire up allowMultiple prop

### 2. Out-of-Scope Features Removed
**Removed**: Make Offer notification, double-boxing notification
**Reason**: Make Offer is buyer-side (Sweep B?), double-boxing is informational only
**Impact**: None - Notifications were not actionable

### 3. Buyer-Side Features Deferred
**Context**: Full buyer-side flow includes:
- Buyer uses GISTer agent to search with criteria
- Agent matches based on facets, condition, price
- Seller gets notification of buyer interest
- Negotiation based on verified data

**Status**: Architecture supports this, implementation deferred

### 4. AI Auto-Population Not Implemented
**Documented in**: CONTEXT_AWARE_CHIPS.md
**Status**: Principle established, implementation pending
**Rule**: Premium items with photos should auto-populate, skip notifications

---

## Code Style & Patterns to Maintain

### 1. TypeScript Strict Mode
```typescript
// Always type props and state
interface NotificationListProps {
  notifications: Notification[];
  listingId: string;
  onResolve: () => void;
  fulfillmentType?: string | null; // Optional with null handling
}
```

### 2. Component Composition
```typescript
// Parent passes minimal props, children handle logic
<NotificationList
  notifications={listing.notifications}
  fulfillmentType={listing.fulfillmentType}
  onAddDetail={(text) => handleAddDetail(text)}
/>
```

### 3. Conditional Rendering with Early Returns
```typescript
if (filteredNotifications.length === 0) return null;
```

### 4. JSON String for actionData
```typescript
// Store as JSON string in database
actionData: JSON.stringify({ options: [...], section: '...' })

// Parse in component
const data = notification.actionData ? JSON.parse(notification.actionData) : null;
```

### 5. Toast Feedback for User Actions
```typescript
toast.success('Detail added');
toast.error('Failed to resolve notification');
```
