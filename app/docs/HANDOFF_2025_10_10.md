## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Notification System Cleanup ‚úÖ

**Removed notifications that were out of scope:**
- Deleted `notif-7`: "Consider Make Offer option" - buyer-side feature, not ready yet
- Deleted `notif-8`: "Fragile vintage doll requires double-boxing" - informational, no action needed

**Fixed notification classifications:**
- Changed `notif-2` from PHOTO to INSIGHT type (box condition advice, not photo request)
- Changed `notif-14` field from `fineDetails` to `NULL` (smoke-free home is description text, not platform field)

### 2. Locals Only Shipping Filter ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Shipping notifications still showed when user selected "Locals Only" fulfillment

**Solution**:
- Added `fulfillmentType` prop to `NotificationList` component
- Filter out notifications with `field === 'shipping'` when `fulfillmentType === 'local'`
- Updated `listing-detail.tsx` to pass `fulfillmentType` to `NotificationList`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/listing/[id]/_components/notification-list.tsx`
- `app/listing/[id]/_components/listing-detail.tsx`

**Result**: Shipping notifications (insurance, USPS Priority, etc.) now automatically disappear when "Locals Only" is selected

### 3. Platform-Specific Fields Expansion ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Premium "Fine Details" tabs were mostly empty or contained duplicate fields from main form

**Solution**: Comprehensive hardwired platform-specific fields based on item category

**Files Modified**:
- `app/listing/[id]/_components/platform-preview.tsx`

**New Fields by Platform**:

#### eBay (8+ fields)
- Handling Time (universal)
- UPC/EAN (electronics)
- MPN - Manufacturer Part Number (electronics)
- ISBN (books)
- Publication Year (books)
- Size Type (clothing)
- Country of Manufacture (collectibles)

#### Mercari (2 fields)
- Shipping Weight ‚ö†Ô∏è required
- Department (clothing)

#### Poshmark (3 fields)
- Department ‚ö†Ô∏è required
- Original Retail Price
- NWT - New With Tags (clothing)

#### Facebook Marketplace (3 fields)
- Fulfillment Options
- Mileage (vehicles)
- VIN (vehicles)

#### OfferUp (2 fields)
- Firm Price?
- Mileage (vehicles)

#### Craigslist (4 fields)
- Neighborhood/Area
- Delivery Available?
- VIN (vehicles)
- Mileage (vehicles)

#### Nextdoor (2 fields)
- Pickup Instructions
- Cross-posted elsewhere?

#### Reverb (6 fields)
- Year
- Serial Number
- Finish/Color
- Country of Manufacture
- Handedness (guitars/basses)
- Includes (accessories)

#### Vinted (2 fields)
- Package Size ‚ö†Ô∏è required
- Gender (clothing)

**Key Features**:
- Category-based conditional logic (e.g., VIN only shows for vehicles)
- Auto-population from listing data where possible
- Confidence scores with "AI uncertain" badges
- Platform-specific badges ("eBay only", "Reverb only", etc.)

### 4. Context-Aware Chips System ‚úÖ

**Already Working**:
- Chip bin reads `notificationData.options` array
- Question-based notifications parse options from message
- "If AI knows enough to ask the question, it must provide the answers"

**Documentation Created**:
- `docs/CONTEXT_AWARE_CHIPS.md` - Complete system documentation
- Principle: AI must research options when generating notifications
- Premium items with photos ‚Üí auto-populate, no notification
- Premium items without photos ‚Üí notification with options

### 5. Multi-Entry Chip Support (In Progress) üîÑ

**Problem**: Notifications like "Is there anything else buyers should know?" require multiple entries

**Solution Started**:
- Added `allowMultiple` prop to SmartChipBin component
- Added `addedItems` state to track entries
- Modified chip handlers to NOT close immediately when `allowMultiple === true`
- Added toast feedback: "Detail added! Add more or tap Done."

**Still TODO**:
- Add "Done" button at bottom of chip bin
- Show list of added items in banner at top
- Pass `allowMultiple={true}` from notification-list for appropriate notifications

**Files Modified**:
- `app/listing/[id]/_components/smart-chip-bin.tsx`

### 6. Special Items & Facets Documentation ‚úÖ

**Created**: `docs/SPECIAL_ITEMS_FEATURE.md`

**Key Concepts**:
- **Facets**: 5 value-defining feature categories
  1. Authentication (tags, serials, signatures)
  2. Condition (paint, integrity, wear)
  3. Rarity (limited runs, variants, prototypes)
  4. Provenance (packaging, certificates, history)
  5. Completeness (accessories, manuals, ephemera)

- **Antiques Roadshow Experience**: "Do you have any idea what this is worth?" revelation moment
- **PHOTO Workflow**: 6-step process from capture to condition analysis
- **Quality Verification System**: Premium feature for Special Items
- **Value Calculation**: Example showing $1,500 ‚Üí $12,700 with verified facets

### 7. Verified Condition Report ‚úÖ

- Aggregates accepted photo scores into `Listing.verifiedConditionScore` and derives `Listing.verifiedCondition`.
- Listing UI displays the GISTer Verified badge, four-dimension progress bars, and tightens the price band to ¬±7% when verification data exists.
- Respects `userPreferences.conditionReportMode` (all / premium / off) before surfacing the report.

### 8. Premium Specials & Roadshow Reveal ‚úÖ

- Photo verification deduplicates facets, infers `specialClass`, persists capped `priceUplifts`, and toggles `Listing.isPremiumItem`.
- Roadshow Reveal card surfaces baseline vs verified value, facet contributions, and a Quality Verification Pack CTA for non-premium users.
- Pricing ladder now routes through `applyPremiumUplift`, ensuring special uplifts never exceed +20% and are skipped for parts-only listings.

## Database Changes

### Notifications Deleted
```sql
DELETE FROM "AINotification" WHERE id = 'notif-7';  -- Make Offer (buyer-side)
DELETE FROM "AINotification" WHERE id = 'notif-8';  -- Double-boxing (informational)
```

### Notifications Updated
```sql
-- Reclassify box condition from PHOTO to INSIGHT
UPDATE "AINotification"
SET type = 'INSIGHT', actionType = 'add_detail', field = 'photos'
WHERE id = 'notif-2';

-- Fix smoke-free home field (description, not fineDetails)
UPDATE "AINotification"
SET field = NULL
WHERE id = 'notif-14';

-- Add origin options for context-aware chips
UPDATE "AINotification"
SET
  message = 'Is this from Japan, Germany, or the US? Origin affects value',
  actionData = '{"options": ["Japan", "Germany", "The US"], "section": "fineDetails"}',
  field = NULL
WHERE id = 'notif-12';
```

## Key Files Modified

| File | Changes | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `app/listing/[id]/_components/notification-list.tsx` | Added `fulfillmentType` filtering | Hide shipping notifications for locals only |
| `app/listing/[id]/_components/listing-detail.tsx` | Pass `fulfillmentType` prop | Enable notification filtering |
| `app/listing/[id]/_components/smart-chip-bin.tsx` | Added `allowMultiple` support | Multi-entry chip selection |
| `app/listing/[id]/_components/platform-preview.tsx` | Comprehensive field expansion | Platform-specific fields |

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Platform Fields Are Hardwired
**Decision**: Platform-specific fields are category-based and hardwired, not AI-generated

**Rationale**:
- Each platform has specific required/optional fields
- Fields are conditional based on item category (e.g., VIN for vehicles)
- AI can populate values, but field requirements are deterministic
- More reliable than AI-generated field discovery

### 2. Notification Field Semantics
**Clarified**:
- `field: "fineDetails"` = Platform-specific conditional fields (UPC, ISBN, Serial Number, etc.)
- `field: NULL` or `field: "description"` = Marketing copy, descriptive text
- `field: "shipping"` = Used for filtering when fulfillment type is local

### 3. Buyer-Side Features Deferred
**Decision**: Removed "Make Offer" and buyer-agent features

**Context**: Buyer-side flow includes:
- Buyer uses GISTer agent to search with criteria
- Agent matches based on facets, condition, price
- Seller gets notification of buyer interest
- Negotiation based on verified data

**Status**: To be implemented in future iteration

## Testing Checklist

### Pricing Ladder & Quick Facts
- [ ] Condition change recalculates price using ladder bands
- [ ] Price deviations ‚â•15% emit INSIGHT chips with suggested dollar amount
- [ ] Quick Facts inserts lines, persists per user/category, and flips to "For parts / not working" when Inoperable is chosen

### Purple Photo Workflow
- [ ] Purple chip opens inline capture/upload dialog with requirement hint
- [ ] Uploading poor quality image returns actionable rejection reasons
- [ ] Uploading clear image resolves notification, appends summary to condition notes, and marks photo as verified in gallery

### Notification Filtering
- [ ] Create listing
- [ ] Select "Locals Only" fulfillment
- [ ] Verify shipping notifications disappear
- [ ] Switch back to "Shipping"
- [ ] Verify shipping notifications reappear

### Platform-Specific Fields
- [ ] Enable premium on listing
- [ ] Select multiple platforms (eBay, Reverb, Poshmark)
- [ ] Verify tabs appear for each platform
- [ ] Check fields are category-appropriate (electronics get UPC, books get ISBN, etc.)
- [ ] Verify confidence badges show for uncertain fields
- [ ] Verify auto-population from listing data

### Context-Aware Chips
- [ ] Tap notification: "Is this from Japan, Germany, or the US?"
- [ ] Verify chip bin shows: Japan, Germany, The US, Unknown
- [ ] Select option and verify it adds to description
- [ ] Test with other question-based notifications

### Multi-Entry (Partial)
- [ ] Current state: Chips add and toast shows "Add more or tap Done"
- [ ] Still need: Done button and added items list display

---

## Known Issues

### 1. Multi-Entry Incomplete
**Status**: Foundation code in place, UI incomplete

**Missing**:
- "Done" button at bottom
- Added items list display at top
- `allowMultiple` prop not yet passed from notification-list

**Next Steps**: Complete UI elements and wire up allowMultiple prop

### 2. Dev Server Background Processes
**Issue**: Multiple background dev servers running

**Impact**: None (only one is active on port 3000)

**Cleanup**: Can kill stale processes with `killall node` if needed

## Technical Notes

### Helper Text Changes
**All notifications**: Changed from "Tap to add details with smart chips" / "Tap to fill with smart chips" ‚Üí **"Tap to address"**

**Rationale**: More concise, works for all notification types

### PHOTO Notifications
**Behavior**: Show contextual helper text based on photo requirement
- "Add close-up of eyes" ‚Üí "üì∏ Select to add closeup"
- "Add detail shot" ‚Üí "üì∏ Select to add detailed photo"
- Clicking opens Camera/Upload dialog

### Smoke-Free Home
**Classification**: INSIGHT (premium feature), adds to description

**Not a platform field**: Determined that no supported platforms have "smoke-free" or "storage environment" as required fields

**Platforms checked**: eBay, Mercari, Poshmark, Reverb, Facebook, OfferUp, Craigslist, Nextdoor, Vinted

---

## Questions for Next Session

1. Should we add more platform-specific fields? (e.g., more eBay Item Specifics by category)
2. Do we need to support dropdown/select fields in platform preview, or is text input sufficient?
3. What notifications should trigger `allowMultiple` mode?
4. Should the "Done" button also resolve the notification, or just close the chip bin?

**Database**: Local Docker PostgreSQL (`gister_postgres` container)
**Git Branch**: `feature/gister-notifications-revamp`
**Status**: Modified files ready for commit when approved
