## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Load Unpacked Extension (Recommended for Development)

This method is for loading the extension directly from source code.

#### Step 1: Download Extension Files

**Option A: Clone from Git Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gist-list-extension.git
cd gist-list-extension
```

#### Step 2: Prepare Icon Files

The extension requires icon files in PNG format. Generate them from the provided SVG:

**Using Inkscape (Recommended):**

inkscape assets/icon.svg -w 32 -h 32 -o assets/icon32.png
inkscape assets/icon.svg -w 48 -h 48 -o assets/icon48.png
inkscape assets/icon.svg -w 128 -h 128 -o assets/icon128.png
```

**Using Online Converter:**
1. Go to any SVG to PNG converter (e.g., convertio.co, cloudconvert.com)
2. Upload `assets/icon.svg`
3. Generate PNG files in sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128
4. Save them as `icon16.png`, `icon32.png`, etc. in the `assets/` folder

**Using ImageMagick:**
```bash
convert assets/icon.svg -resize 16x16 assets/icon16.png
convert assets/icon.svg -resize 32x32 assets/icon32.png
convert assets/icon.svg -resize 48x48 assets/icon48.png
